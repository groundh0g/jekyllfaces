If you're thinking about writing a book (or several), it's hard to beat [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for writing your draft. Create a folder for [your book](), include a `summary.md` file and a `cover.png` file, then start writing chapters as separate markdown files. Jekyll Faces tracks your progress, updating word counts as you edit.

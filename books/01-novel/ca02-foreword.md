#Foreword

This is my first attempt at writing a novel. I wrote a technical book back in 2007 that was fairly well received. But fiction, with its complex relationships and twists, is a whole new beast for me.

This work started as a simple idea that I shared with my wife. She insisted that I put ink to paper. So, after much urging, I started the outline and character development. I liked how things were flowing, so I decided to pull the trigger and commit to fleshing out the text.

This title is intended to be the second in a series of three novels. I plan to write the prequel if the feedback for this book is positive, and I'll write the sequel to wrap things up if the first two don't absolutely flop.

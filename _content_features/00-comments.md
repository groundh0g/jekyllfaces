Even though Jekyll builds static sites, that doesn't mean that you can't have dynamic features [like comments]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/00-comments.html). Jekyll Faces supports several vendors, including [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/comments/) and [Disqus](https://disqus.com/).

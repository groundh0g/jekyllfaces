Jekyll Faces provides out-of-the-box support for a variety of web-based icon fonts, including Font Awesome, Glyphicons, and Foundation. We use [GlyphSearch](http://glyphsearch.com/) to identify the icons we would like to include, then [add those glyphs]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/01-font-icons.html) to our pages.

## Steven Lowe

Steven Lowe is currently a Principal Consultant Developer for ThoughtWorks. In that role, he is a rabid proponent of test-driven development, speaking in various venues both here and abroad. He has been programming professionally since around 1987. Steven is somewhat obsessed with helping clients achieve success as they define it, and as such is unafraid to ask “stupid” questions like “Why are we doing this?” and “What would wild success look like?”. He's also a published author of both fiction and tech books.

## Andrew Rollings

Andrew Rollings has written several books, all connected in some way or another with his love of games - the most notable being *Game Architecture and Design*, which has been the reference for many a college and secondary education course. Andrew is an ex-UK resident who currently lives in an underground bunker in an undisclosed location. He earns his keep by architecting and developing software for companies that span a wide variety of fields. In his spare time, you may see him working on his next console or handheld game.

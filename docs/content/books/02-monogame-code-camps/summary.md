### MonoGame: Code Camps

In this series, I follow the same general principles that drove the first book. I write the books that help the beginner without boring the more-experienced readers to tears. I write the books that contain examples that go beyond rainbow triangles and 3D cubes with crate textures. In short, I write the books that I, as a hobbyist game developer, would want to read. If you enjoy the book as well (and I sincerely hope you do), I consider that an added bonus.

There was so much content to cover in this new work that I decided to break it into five separate volumes (plus a sixth volume for my annual summer camp on game programming). Each book stands on its own. As much as possible, later volumes donâ€™t assume that you own the previous volumes. If, for example, you want to dive into 3D and you have a few XNA or MonoGame game projects under your belt, then, by all means, jump straight to Volume 3: 3D Genre Studies.

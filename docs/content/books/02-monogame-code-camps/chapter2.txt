"Our greatest glory is not in never failing, but in rising up every time we fail."
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson
 
I believe we learn best from failure. Success teaches us precious little. We learn what works by stumbling, fumbling, and floundering over that which does not work. If you never make a mistake, you are not learning. You are simply following someone else's recipe for success. I can confidently assure you that the author of the recipe did not create it on their first attempt, complete and without error.

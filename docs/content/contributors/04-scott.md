Scott Escue is an expert in enterprise Java development using a mix of web technologies. He's been paying the bills with a keyboard and a compiler since 2001 - engaging with new technologies and solving problems both large and small. While most of his experience in the database world has been with Oracle, he also works with a variety of open-source data store solutions.

His interests aren't limited to the Java world, though. When away from the day job, Scott uses Ruby and Rails for his personal projects. And, while not quite the expert yet, he has been flexing his iOS and Android application development muscles. You can find an example of Scott's open-source projects at [Dropwizard EntityManager](http://scottescue.com/dropwizard-entitymanager/){:target="_blank"} on GitHub.

At the time of this writing, “the team” has just one member &mdash; me, [groundh0g](https://github.com/groundh0g/){:target="_blank"}. 
As the project progresses, I’d love to have people with similar passions for extending [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} 
with [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/){:target="_blank"} while preserving compatibility with 
the latest [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"}. Until I find others to join my mission, I’ll be using 
a few of the most talented developers I know to help me with design and technology decisions.

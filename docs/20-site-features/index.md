The vanilla install of Jekyll is great for simple blogs, but you have a good bit of tweaking ahead of you if you want to extend that basic functionality. Jekyll Faces provides configurable features that make your site more full-featured.

Out of the box, Jekyll Faces provides support for the following features:

* [Analytics](01-analytics.html): Use a 3rd-party script for usage statistics. Target content for users, browsers, and locations.
* [Comments](02-comments.html): Build community around your site by allowing visitors to discuss your posts.
* [Font Icons](03-font-icons.html): Select from several icon sets to use in the text on your site.
* [404 Pages](04-specifying-a-404-page.html): Avoid boring file-not-found pages by selecting one from many Jekyll Faces provides.
* [Main Menu](05-navbar-menu.html): Filter and name the main menu links for your site.
* [Search](06-search.html): Let Jekyll Faces know when and how to provide search for you content.
* [Footer](07-footer.html): Define common content for all pages in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 columns.

title: "The Footer"
---

The footer is based on a 12-column grid layout. So, footer element counts of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12 are supported. Footer elements are described in separate markdown files in the `_content_footer` folder. Styles are store stored in the `assets/jekyllfaces.css` file.

You can name the footer element files any way you want, and they will be listed in filename order.

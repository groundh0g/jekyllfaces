&laquo; This is an example of the kind of documentation you can add to your project's site.

Each page of content is represented by a markdown file in the `docs/` folder. Content can be grouped using sub-folders. You can also include a summary of each group with an `index.md` file in each folder. 

```
    /docs/00-homepage/images/project.png
    /docs/00-homepage/images/soon.png
    /docs/00-homepage/01-blogging.md
    /docs/00-homepage/02-page-soon.md
    /docs/00-homepage/03-page-project.md
    /docs/00-homepage/index.md
    /docs/01-where-does-it-go.md
    /docs/02-layouts-and-templates.md
    /docs/03-hosting-on-github-pages.md
    /docs/index.md
    ...
```

Documents in the table of contents are sorted by filename, so we've prefixed each file with a number to force a particular order. You can name your files according to document title, and just let them bubble into a natural order if you like.

One of the benefits of using Jekyll Faces is that it can present many faces, making it easier to build sites that seemed tailored to the projects being hosted. Out of the box, your site can feel like a: 

* traditional [blog](01-blogging.html)
* software [project](03-page-project.html) or product
* landing page for an [upcoming project](02-page-soon.html)
* [web application](../10-content-pages/05-web-applications.html)
* [book(s)](../10-content-pages/02-books.html) online

Just select one of the available homepage options in the `_config.yml` file.

```
  # one of [blog | project | soon | webapps]
  homepage: project
```

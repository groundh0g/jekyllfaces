Every site needs a blog, right? Well, [JekyllFaces](https://jekyllfaces.com/) is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) so blogging is baked right in. But it takes some work to format, segment, and display those posts. JekyllFaces adds several templates for displaying groups of posts, like recent posts, featured posts, and post archives.

### Shoply Blog List Style

![Blogs Example]({{ "/assets/images/blog/feature-blogs-shoply.png" | relative_url }} "Blogs Example")

<hr/>

### Newsly Blog List Style

![Blogs Example]({{ "/assets/images/blog/feature-blogs-newsly.png" | relative_url }} "Blogs Example")

<hr/>

### Plainly Blog List Style

![Blogs Example]({{ "/assets/images/blog/feature-blogs-plainly.png" | relative_url }} "Blogs Example")

<hr/>

All the colors and styles for the posts can be set in the `_jekyllfaces/config.md` file. No code changes are needed.
